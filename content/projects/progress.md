# Real-Estate Website
<p>Website for our real-estate business was created from ground-up using Nuxt2 framework and Tailwindcss. Theme evolved from previously prototyped HTML version.</p>
<p>We used infinie loading approach on home page with latest listings without ability to sort. Listing details included two custom carousels - big image and thumbnails. Gallery was also accessible through lightbox package and fully responsive layout allowed different device to browse comfortably.</p>
<div class="flex w-full">
<img
    src="/progfront.png"  
    class="mx-auto w-1/2"
/>
<img
    src="/progofe.png" 
    class="mx-auto w-1/2"
/>
</div>
<p>This website was recently converted to Wordpress to reduce maintenance cost and assistance required to deploy changes. While the features didn't change, I have added fully fledged sorting, pagination and filtering using PHP. Our administration panel uses custom developed plugin for listing management.</p>
