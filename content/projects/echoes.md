# Echoes.gg
Echoes.gg was my first project using vue2. It started as a tool for one of mobile games (developped and published by NetEase Games, which I was working for volunatrily at that time). It quickly developed into fully featured social network for thousands of users.

App allowed for game data simulation, featuring complex modals, exportable setups using hash, drag and drop components, offline and online usage and multi property search.

Backend was created using express.js and passport for authentication with custom oauth strategy to connect discord users with email/password users. I have used hasura.io to deliver real time notifications and data to the user. App featured online indicators, user following, direct messages and public/private data.

Over 5000 users that joined and used this application daily submitted over 75000 setups for other users. It was the biggest project I have developed all by myself with lack of any knowledge about backend. Ultimately it reached EOL back in 2021 as I started working on real-estate business.
