# This portfolio
Created in Nuxt3 but overengineered to showcase my approach to different scenarios as I could not share code for some of the projects I have worked on previously.

This open-source portoflio is fully typed, and, to my knowledge, uses best practices and patterns.
I used intersection observers to handle active slide for navigation, nuxt/content to render descriptions for projects and vue teleport to display modal windows with props without any prop drilling or context.
Project uses nuxt-icon to optimize svg icons and various vue macros such as defineEmits or defineProps.
